    <h1>discography</h1>
    <p>British rock band Queen consisted of vocalist Freddie Mercury (d. 1991), guitarist Brian May, drummer Roger Taylor, and bassist John Deacon (r. 1997). Founded in 1970, Queen released their self-titled debut album in 1973. Despite not being an immediate success, Queen gained popularity in Britain with their second album Queen II in 1974.[1] Their 1975 song, "Bohemian Rhapsody", was number 1 for nine weeks (and a further five weeks in 1991) and is the third biggest selling single of all time in the UK.[2] In the US, "Bohemian Rhapsody" hit the Billboard Top 40 charts in three different decades, reaching number 9 in its original 1975 release, number 2 in 1992 after being featured in the film Wayne's World, and hitting the top 40 once more in 2018 upon the release of the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody. The band's 1981 Greatest Hits album is the biggest selling album in UK history with 6.0 million copies sold by 2014. The band's 1991 compilation Greatest Hits II is also one of the UK's top ten biggest sellers of all time, with 3.8 million copies sold by 2012.[3] </p>
